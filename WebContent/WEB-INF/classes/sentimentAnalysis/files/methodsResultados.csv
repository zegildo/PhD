Still Renato Mimica analyst BTG Pactual reiterates the purchase of Localiza's papers to see the company well positioned to sustain growth and returns between the short and medium term. Mimica admits that the United tends to regain market share lost over the past two years increased from 12% in 2008 to 7% in 2010 and thus harm the case of investments located. He adds however that the shortterm effects generated by the competitor will be barely noticeable. We believe that the overall outlook for Localiza remains positive as the United of investors tend to focus first and foremost on the payroll of the restructuring of administrative changes and where to direct the company's strategy. These steps are time consuming SAYS analyst report. Fragmented market rental car brings good opportunities Localiza has about 24% market share for gross proceeds rental car against 7 5% of United. In a market with small and uncompetitive players there is room for both companies increase their share of participation; But the gains of scale favor Localiza says Mimica. While the shortterm brings few fears to the main issue of longterm analyst says it will be the strategy adopted by United. The company can either replicate the aggressive policy of Localiza in car rental expansion as choosing to act only in a niche market. Shortterm drivers Good prospects BTG Pactual will be confirmed on the balance sheet of the second quarter of 2011 the company being reported on July 13. Although toughest competitors the company tends to bring growth rates higher than those seen in the previous period according to the bank. Smaller fears about inflation also tend to favor action in the short term.

According to Lima ANP can regulate the supply stocks and stipulate goals. The Valor Economico newspaper reported earlier that the concern with rising ethanol prices may lead to changes in the fuel mix used in gasoline. Cosan largest sugar company and the world lost 34 percent ethanol biggest decline since February 9 for 2595 reais. St. Martin fell 32 percent for 2491 minimum of one week real. Investors fear that the initiative of the President to increase state presence in fastgrowing sectors in Brazil could lead to price controls and lower profits. The President is promoting the implementation of new rules for the oil industry and its coalition are evaluating changes in royalties for mining legislation. The government may be trying to use regulation to curb the fastest rise in inflation in six years. Ethanol prices an important component in transport prices jump 70 percent since September. We see that the news is very negative for the sector not only the measures themselves but also because the agribusiness in Brazil has been seen... as an attractive sector given its competitiveness and the absence of government interference, said analyst Luiz Otavio Fields of Credit Suisse in a report. Over the past three years the sugar conglomerates made smaller competitors acquisitions ensuring greater control over the supply and price of energy in the ethanol industry. Government by Petrobras in turn did not follow the pace of mergers between their private competitors. Article value suggests that the government will try to convince executives of sugar and ethanol to align their interests with those of the nation. Failing that said value can even take the president to impose taxes on exports of sugar. A tariff on sugar said Campos may have no effect on the volume of sugarcane for the production of ethanol because Brazil dominates the global sugar market. This means that the increase in export taxes can actually lead to higher global sugar prices because these will be adjusted because of higher taxation to maintain high profit sugar watched him. 	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	-1	-1	-1	1	1	1	-1	1	-1	1	1	1

Since the company announced in late June a plan to migrate its securities traded on the Bovespa for the American market accumulated depreciation already exceeds 30%. Today the shares were traded at R $ 2530.

While Cosan plans to change their current roles circulating on Bovespa's Novo Mercado for these new shares. It will be up to the investor choose whether to change their roles by BDRs or shares traded in the United States. If the membership exceeds twothirds of shareholders the company must then buy back all their current roles in order to close the capital of the Brazilian subsidiary. The devaluation of recent days indicates that Cosan should raise far less than the nearly $ 2 billion it planned to offer. The money will be used to fund acquisitions and the expansion of production. The decision to move to New York was taken in order to facilitate foreign investment in the company. Residents of other countries have held more than 70% of Cosan's shares just before the company decides to migrate. For the entrepreneur Rubens Ometto not lose control of the company by issuing new shares that will put more than 50% of its capital in the market the company decided that the roles of the driver would give you the right to 10 votes more than the other roles. The market reacted badly to the proposal because the shares were listed on the Novo Mercado  where preferred shares are not traded (nonvoting). Later the company decided to change its proposal and create a new type of action for those who want to stay at least three years with the paper. In this case the investor will also be entitled to ten votes per paper. The change in the proposal came to cheer investors but for a short period of time. Displaying a rapid recovery of Cosan shares back to being one of the most punished in the Bovespa amid the crisis of world markets have contributed to the fall in sugar prices. The product oversupply this year also contributed to reducing investor appetite for shares of Cosan. A third complicating are the holidays in the United States reduce the number of potential investors in the market. 	-1	1	0	0	0	1	0	-1	0	1	1	-1	1	-1	1	1	1	1	-1

Even already provided such a move government analysts point out that news will be positive for producers of fuel listed on the stock exchange  Cosan (CSAN3) São Martinho (SMTO3) and Tereos (TERI3). However, this adjustment has been expected for a long time so much so that the roles of sector companies have already presented positive response to these speculations. December forth the shares of Cosan  their only part of the Bovespa index  rose by about 85% while the roles of São Martinho have gone over 20% in the same period while the Tereos won over 11% of value Marketplace. The performance exceeds the benchmark Brazilian stock market in the same period rose just over 7%. Analysts at XP Investimentos understand that the three companies have room to grow if the change is implemented but among them brokerage follows with preference for Cosan  although she point out that the company is not the most benefit from this adjustment. Already the Barclays team says Cosan and São Martinho must be the greatest beneficiaries of this he kept the recommendation overweight (similar purchase) for both companies. One of the major points highlighted by Barclays is the demand for ethanol could reach 3 billion liters in case of increasing the amount in gasoline. Also anhydrous ethanol  used in mixing with gasoline  is more profitable than the price of hydrated alcohol  used directly as fuel  as their prices are not linked directly to the price of gasoline. These factors should boost the profitability of producers because the ethanol is 20% of Ebitda (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) of St. Martin and 23% of Ebitda Raizen.

On Thursday (28) Vivendi announced that it will enter into exclusive negotiations with Telefonica for the sale of GVT. The operator was also held by Telecom Italia parent company of TIM in Brazil. Vivendi will receive 466 billion euros (US $ 614 billion) in Telefonica's money which is an increase in the cash portion of a previous offer presented by the Spanish to face the proposal of Telecom Italia. In addition to the cash portion Telefonica will give Vivendi a 12% stake in the Brazilian company combined of which about one third can be exchanged for a 57% stake in Telecom Italia to Vivendi desired. Competition According to Valente was given within 90 days for the purchase of GVT is completed but Telefonica expects that happen before. After that the transaction will be submitted to regulatory agencies including the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) and Cade. The main question is whether these organs will impose some restriction on business due to the concentration in the broadband market with the union between Vivo (controlled by Telefonica) and GVT that can generate competitive imbalance. In Valente evaluation the merger will give the company better able to face the industry leader in the Net outside São Paulo markets where GVT is now more present. In São Paulo where Vivo operates more strongly the president of Telefonica pointed out that GVT arrived recently and has many customers relatively small which should facilitate the approval of the transaction by CADE and by Anatel.

In a statement, the bank said the decision has no immediate effect and will appeal the decision. The Court analyzed the bank's appeal on court ruling dating back to 2009, when the 12th Civil Court of Brasília was judged public civil action filed by the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Defense (Idec). That year, the Court had already condemned the bank to pay the socalled  inflation effects  which occur when inflation rates are not applied in savings and generate loss in the income deposited. The Bank of Brazil appealed to the court claiming that the sentence should be valid only for open savings accounts in the Federal District and only savers associated with Idec, plaintiff would have standing to seek the judgment. In the rapporteur's view feature in the STJ, Minister Luis Felipe Solomon, the former trial had decided that the decision should include all savers who kept account in the Bank of Brazil in January 1989, and not just those residing in the Federal District and were linked to Idec.

Almost 400,000 cases on economic plans are to conduct suspended in various courts since 2010, awaiting a Supreme Court decision. Plaintiffs argue that suffered losses and want to receive the corrected values ​​based on inflation. The Supreme Court judgment of Wednesday in Superior Court is different from the judgment of the Supreme Court (STF), in which the Supreme Court will determine the validity of economic plans and the restatement of the books values ​​occurred within the law. The trial would be held in late March, but was postponed and there is no new date. If the court finds that the percentage used by the plans was correct, many savers will not be entitled to anything. In that case, the Supreme Court can evaluate what to do with those who have received money from the banks by decision of other courts. Should the Supreme consider the irregular used index should stipulate how the payment of the correction of savings balances will be done. 	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	-1	1	1	-1	1	-1	-1	-1	1	-1	1

1	ALPARGATAS SA, ALPARGATAS, Alpargatas renews contract with Mizuno, Alpargatas anticipated new contract to distribute the Japanese brand Mizuno in Brazil and some countries in Latin America. The agreement expiring in 2016 was renewed on Thursday 16 and will run for another 13 years with possibility of extension of another 13. The holding of the World Cup and the Olympics in Brazil motivated the company to anticipate the negotiation.  We can invest more in brands for major sporting events now that we know that contracts continue into effect after 2016,  said the director of sporting goods Alpargatas Fernando Beer. Alpargatas began distributing the Mizuno brand in Brazil in 1997 and has since renewed the contract three times. The company pays royalties to the Japanese manufacturer but financial details not are open. Most products sold in Brazil are imported. Alpargatas however intends to increase the share of footwear made in the country.  We need to expand local production to support the Brazilian market growth,  said Beer. Today marks leads the country in high performance tennis thread to run. This makes Brazil the second largest market behind Japan Mizuno. The contract with the Japanese company allows Alpargatas represent the brand in Brazil Argentina Uruguay Paraguay and Chile but today the company sells Japanese brand only in Brazil and Argentina.  We intend to expand into new markets. We are evaluating it,  said Beer. Strategy The partnership with Mizuno is strategic for Alpargatas group also owns brands such as Havaianas and Topper Queen. The Mizuno's sales have quadrupled in the past five years and have made the Japanese the fastest growing brand in the Brazilian group. Only in the third quarter of 2013 revenue of Alpargatas with Mizuno products rose 48% compared to the same period last year according to company balance data. The company does not open data revenues by brand but it is estimated that half of the Mizuno concentrate Alpargatas revenues from sporting goods  an amount that totaled approximately R $ 625 million in the first nine months of 2013. The segment is gaining relevance in group and already represented 37% of the company's revenue in the third quarter of 2013 three percentage points above the weight it had in the same period in 2012. The World Cup and Olympics sporting goods market is expected to grow further during the World Cup and Olympics estimates coordinator Sports Marketing MBA from ESPM Clarisse Setyon. ? The segment traditionally suffers a consumer boom that period especially in the countries that host the games? I said. For her the renewal of the contract with Mizuno is critical to Alpargatas compete with big multinational companies like Nike and Adidas sports.  It is cheaper to invest in a brand that is already desired by the user to create one from scratch  rating. Alpargatas wants to enjoy the Cup and the Olympics in Brazil to raise the Mizuno sales and try to gain presence in other sports like handball soccer and volleyball. For this the company prepares a strengthening of their marketing strategy but will have to circumvent barriers imposed by the organizers of the games. Adidas is an official sponsor of the World Cup and Nike's national team. The Mizuno therefore can not make direct mention of the event or the team of Brazil.  Let's explore the images of athletes we sponsor the selection Hulk and Dede 'said Beer.  Our best bet will be in the Olympics. The Mizuno has a strong presence in Rio  completed.

-1	EBX SA BRAZIL, BRAZIL EBX, Eike has 72.5% of the equity in the United States. Shares held in offshore holdings represent R $ 13.87 billion fortune of the richest man in the country, Two companies headquartered abroad concentrate 72 5% of the total direct interest of Eike Batista in shares of its subsidiaries OGX OSX MMX LLX and MPX CCX. A survey conducted by the consulting firm Economática shows that the shares held in these offshore holdings represent R $ 13 87 billion fortune of the richest man in the country. The US state of Nevada was the place selected by billionaire to Centennial Asset Mining Fund LLC which in turn controls the Centennial Asset Brazilian Equity Fund LLC. Through these companies Eike holds the largest share of its participation in the six Brazilian companies. Going up a little more in the corporate maze created by tycoon one line chart shows that the Centennial Mining has the sole administrator (sole director) EBX International SA chaired by billionaire based in Panama known tax haven in Central America. The value calculated using a survey of shareholdings made by Economática may have suffered some recent change without greater relevance. The businessman announced this year the sale of two minority shares in Centennial Brazilian and other offshore holding companies to the Arab fund Mubadala (5 63%) and GE (0 8%). Eike still appears as the owner of 100% of the shares of the two companies in reference forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) for 2011 the latest documents filed in this type of market regulator. As the group did not detail how the transaction was made and that other offshore would be involved is difficult to say what would have changed in the relationship. But because of the percentage involved changing the figure would be marginal. The use of this type of structure is not illegal. Unlike some companies that support this deception to hide who your real Eike controller does not hide that he is the one behind these holdings. For two weeks the state report expected by the EBX answers on the subject but the company preferred not to comment about it. Undiagnosed. Ears lawyers state they say it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of the reason that led Eike to opt for this structure and point out that each company has a different goal when deciding to open a holding in another country. Sought the EBX group did not respond to questions. The main motivation pointed in such cases is to reduce tax expenses. The underlying objective of the creation of offshore companies is to seek a more positive scenario in terms of tax benefits related to Income Tax and Social Contribution on Profit explains the expert in tax law Paulo Sigaud of Aidar SBZ Lawyers. It OGX  oil and gas company and the most valuable among the six listed on the BM  FBovespa  that Eike holds the most representative value in shares through their foreign holdings. The fraction of 61 22% magnate whose speech is heavily marked by nationalist elements equivalent to R $ 11 billion. In the OSX company's shipbuilding industry executive has almost R $ 2 billion in stock for a slice of 59 3% via their offshore. The lowest figures are in their company MMX mining (iron ore) and CCX (coal). The numbers were measured by Economática based on the stock prices of companies on 8 October. Experts explain that some Brazilians use offshore to sell and buy publicly traded shares of companies in Brazil taking advantage of a benefit created for foreign investors. This regime implemented to promote the Brazilian capital market allows them to perform this type of operation with tax exemption. This benefit was created for foreign capital coming here but many Brazilians take advantage of this legislation is still in force explains Bruno Ferreira attorney's office Vieira Rezende Barbosa and Warrior. There is insufficient evidence to say that this is the case Eike however. There are rules to regulate the practice and tools to identify who is the ultimate beneficiary and see if it is someone who is in a tax haven. In this case the benefits may be suspended. In addition to the percentage held by foreign companies based billionaire also owns shares as an individual but on a smaller scale. Eike has directly 56 8% stake in fledgling CCX (coal producer) which debuted in May in the bag. In MPX power generation it has 50% and 1 MMX 30%. Tangle. Interest in Eike via offshore holdings in publicly traded companies in the EBX group however may exceed the figure of R $ 13 billion 87. This amount relates to shares held in companies listed on the stock exchange which in turn have subsidiaries that also have as Eike companies shareholders abroad. One example is the 30% that the Centennial Mining has the MMX Corumbá subsidiary of MMX through the EBX Brazil SA The company  which recently had the son of Eike Batista Thor appointed as a director without specific designation  is not the EBX holding. In response at the time about the profile of this company advising the EBX group said only that it was one of the investment vehicles without elaborating on the definition encrypted. In communicated disclosed at the time of sale of fractions of Centennial Brazilian and other holdings to the Arab fund Eike revealed that the new members would also indirect participation in private companies of the group are not included in the survey by Economática. This means that Batista's companies abroad were also part of the capital of REX (real estate market) AUX (gold mining) and IMX (entertainment and exportes) whose value is not known,. 	-1	1	0	1	1	1	0	-1	-1	1	1	1	1	-1	1	-1	1	1	1

1	BCO SA BRAZIL, BRAZIL, the Bank of Brazil is the company of the year, The movement of IPOs on the stock exchange in 2013 can be divided into two phases. The first, until the 24th of April, in which eight initial public offerings ( English Initial Public Offerings or IPOs) and sales of the listed company shares moved R $ 4.4 billion. The second phase, from the launch of the BB Security actions, a company controlled by the Bank of Brazil which is responsible for insurance, pension and capitalization of the bank. From this IPO, the second largest IPO of the stock market history, the year 2013 has become one of the most significant in stock sales, moving R $ 23.4 billion, almost the sum of 2011 and 2012. The launch of the BB Security, which is rapidly moving to become the biggest insurance company, pension plan and capitalization of the country, was worth $ 11.47 billion. investor reserves were three times the offer, and, unlike what happened with most releases of the past year, the shares awarded royally who bought. From launch until the end of August, the stock appreciated 120%, and the market value of BB Security surpassed R $ 70 billion at the end of the month, compared to R $ 92 billion of banco.A new company itself, which the BB has 70% stake, has contributed earnings of R $ 2.5 billion in 2013 and R $ 1.5 billion in the first half of this year, and has fattened the bank's results in more than R $ 7 billion from the sale of securities. The success of the IPO of BB Security plus the growth in the participation of the bank in the credit market and its diversification into new markets made the Bank of Brazil to be chosen Company of the Year by THE BEST MONEY. The company's emergence was a milestone for the Bank of Brazil's business and the Brazilian capital market, says Aldemir Bendine, president of the bank. Going against the market mood, showed that consistent business does not depend on momentary analysis of the economy. Another important point is the growth in loans. BB increased its share of 20.7% of the market in the second quarter of 2013 to 21.3% in June 2014. For a bank, expand the loan portfolio always tends to be a risky move because the trend It is to capture first, the worst customer competition  ie borrowers that offer higher risk of default. However, the Bank has managed to keep default rates below the market average. In June 2013, also due to the aftermath of the increase in default in previous years, the average default of the financial system was 6.2%. At BB, this indicator was 5%. Twelve months later, the combined efforts of the banks to clean up their portfolios started to bear fruit and the average default system had fallen to 4.78%. In the case of BB, the drop was even more significant, to 3.57%. We maintain our focus on lower risk portfolios, model we have adopted long ago and now began to guide the action of other major banks  if the payroll loans, for example, says Bendine. The next steps in addition to enhancing participation in mortgage lending, which has been growing at a rate of 80% per year are to expand lending to the automotive sector through a partnership with Banco Votorantim and extend such cooperation to the credit payroll. The reasoning is simple: the Finance BV, promoter of the Votorantim sales, offers loans for car purchase in a wide network of more than 20,000 resellers of all sizes around the country nothing more logical than to take advantage of this capacity. offer payroll, low risk loans that are the new apple of the eye of the financial system. BB's goal is to maintain the pace of growth. But always seek to grow without our flexible credit policy, characterized by technical rigor and a conservative approach, says Bendine. There is room to grant more credit within the projected levels without the occurrence decrease in portfolio quality. 	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	-1	1	1	1	1	-1	1	-1	1	-1	1

-1	BCO SA BRAZIL, BRAZIL, Brazil's Bank President paid a fine to get rid of Revenue. BB Chief paid a fine to get rid of investigation. The president of the Bank of Brazil, Aldemir Bendine, paid fine of $ 122,000 to IRS to get rid of questions about the evolution of his personal wealth and an apartment paid in cash in 2010. Bendine was booked for not prove the origin of approximately R $ 280,000 reported in its annual statement of adjustment of income tax. In assessing the income, the value of their property increased more than their declared income could justify. Leader of the largest financial institution in Latin America, Bendine has a habit of declaring that keeps cash at home, according to documents to which the Leaf had access. He said in his statements to the IRS have followed four years kind resources between 2009 and 2012, worth at least $ 400,000. Bendine entered the radar of the IRS in 2010, when Folha revealed that he bought one apartment in São Paulo the gross amount of R $ 150 thousand, paid entirely in cash. The executive also said to have made works in property worth £ 50,000. To justify the legality of the real estate transaction, he said told the Revenue have R $ 200 thousand in cash at home, kept since 2009. In 2012, Revenue auditors sent the Bendine an extensive questionnaire on their spending in 2010, asking how he spent on their debit and credit cards, with health, education and other expenses. The executive provided the requested information, but not convinced. In November 2012, it was booked at $ 151,000, including penalties and interest. He did not dispute the assessment and paid the auto in sight, earning a discount. Thus, the bill dropped to R $ 122,460. Bendine says he did not argue with the revenue the origin of funds used in the purchase of apartments and says the tax assessment resulted from a mere error in his statement to the IRS. Even after identifying the error, it does not rectified the statement. QUESTION FAMILY Asked by Folha, Bendine would not talk about money, claiming that it was a family matter. It's not a crime to buy real estate inkind resources. Just as it is not a crime to save money under the mattress. But these practices are considered by tax authorities as withholding signs of taxes and so arouse the curiosity of auditors. The money spent from hand to hand without circulating through the banking system can not be detected by the controls of the IRS and the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF). What reason would someone save a large sum instead of putting in a bank account, in an application? Asks the Institutional Relations director of the Institute Tax Justice, Dan Real Pereira dos Santos, a former superintendent of the Federal Revenue Office in Rio Grande do South. He made an analysis of the case at the request of Folha, without being informed of the taxpayer. It's a situation that naturally reverses the burden of proof, he said. In a normal situation, the Treasury would have to run after the tests. In this situation, no. It is up to the taxpayer to explain why have this money saved at home. It was only in 2009 that Bendine claimed to R $ 200 thousand at home. The following year, he returned to report having the same amount in cash after the acquisition and renovation of the apartment. That is, it was re R $ 200 thousand in cash. In 2011, he claimed to R $ 100 thousand. In 2012, R $ 50 thousand. The President of the Bank of Brazil said that adopted this procedure for considering it at the time the best way to correct the mistake in filling out his statement but recognized that the right would have been present a rectifier statement to the IRS. As required by law, Self immediate payment of offense, as did Bendine, requires the IRS to file the case, which eliminates the possibility of communicating to the Federal Public Ministry to practice any tax crimes committed by the taxpayer. The case was filed Bendine in January this year. 	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	-1	1	1	-1	1	-1	1	-1	1	-1	1

A lot of startups are afraid to look for a company the size of Bradesco, because our first question will be who they are and have the execution capacity we need, says Bradesco's vicepresident, Mauricio Minas. We created the program to these small companies come here to make their products with us, instead of answering a Power Point presentation, he says. From now until October 17, the bank will accept, on the site of  nbsp ;, applications from earlystage companies that are developing their product, but have not yet entered the market. Among those enrolled, 40 companies will be selected to go through an immersion process to meet the bank and will be evaluated on issues such as qualification of the staff, value generation potential, delivery capacity, potential for innovation and risk measurement. Twenty shall be authorized for an evaluation stage with a group of bank executives. Of these, about ten to effectively follow the design phase of the project on banco.A initiative marks the first foray by the Bradesco open innovation. To date, the entire process of developing new solutions the bank was built. There are two or three years, we stopped to ask ourselves if our innovation model was the most efficient. Structured processes and methodologies to the closed innovation, but as we increasingly digital and needed a concept over break, we thought maybe the closed innovation was not enough for us, said Mines. Looking from the outside of the box ideas, the bank decided to resort to startups.  Nbsp; We want to leave the comfort zone and have more business options in the medium and long term, says Mines. The idea of ​​working with startups came after a research on how innovation is being held in American and European markets. Mine says he found that in Brazil there is still no proper appreciation of innovation. The difficulty of startups is not having a good product or business model. Nor is it financially, because there are people willing to give money to these companies. The big problem is the big barrier to entry in how these companies will survive even find a big market, he says. It is this large market that Bradesco to offer to startups chosen for their program. Instead of giving funding for entrepreneurs to touch their projects, Bradesco want to work with them to develop products and offer himself as premium end. The bank seeks solutions in five strategic areas: means of payment, digital channels, safe and Future Bank  which encompasses initiatives that could be adopted in the coming years for any area of ​​the bank. During the six months of development and integration of the product with the bank, startups should be devoted exclusively to Bradesco and could end go to the market looking for other customers. If something ever went to the market is no longer innovative, says Mines. During this period, the bank's professionals will provide support for startups also develop its business model through business consulting. At the end of the program, companies that excel may receive an investment bank.  Nbsp; The private equity fund of Bradesco, focused on medium to large businesses, showed interest in knowing the companies selected by InovaBra to evaluate investment opportunities and eventually create a line for startups.	1	1	0	-1	0	1	0	1	-1	1	1	1	1	-1	1	0	1	1	1

The insurance salesmen were hired by concessionaires, which functioned as small brokers, through which was made the intermediation of hand labor. The practice for the MPT, constituted fraud labor rights, framing on Article 9 of the Labor Code, for which they are null   The acts performed in order to distort, prevent or circumvent the application of the precepts   contained therein.

From 2015 to 2019, will be allocated 193 million per year for this item, compared to R $ 71 million paid by August this year and £ 84 million last year. The volume attracted 161 stalls, now pitted in a bid which has been suspended by the courts last Friday ( 298) by means of an injunction that was overturned on the afternoon of Wednesday (39). The survey of values ​​was obtained exclusively by electronic magazine Counsel. Asked what would have motivated the increase, the bank merely said that the number is only a preview expenditures for the purposes of budget planning of the company. The competition, aimed at the largest ever made in Brazil for legal services, will serve for the Bank of Brazil to take care hire offices without delay of more than 230 thousand cases in labor, criminal, administrative, tax and credit recovery. That is the immediate demand, but the number is likely to increase because the bank has more than 1 million court cases, and internal lawyers take care only of strategic, leaving the mass and less complex for outsourced. People working with the institution claim that due to the proportions that any problems that bidding can take complaints have concerned employees and company lawyers. Suspended last Friday by Judge Marcos Pimentel Tamassia, the 4th Court of the Treasury of São Paulo, competition has become even subject Police and the Federal Audit Court. More than 30 administrative resources, six representations in TCU and to a representation involving criminal case. Office professionals involved in the bidding process claim that, following the decision to suspend the bidding, already expected a rain of injunctions and judicial reviews. Five days later, the same judge overturned the injunction because, he said,   was the main subject of the meeting demand . The revised score change on the understanding Tamassia was because on the day it was granted an injunction suspending the event, the bank published a list with the results and scores of competitors, recounted after the trial of administrative resources. In the new count, the bank recalculated extra score offered the stalls had professionals registered in more than a sectional of the Bar Association of Brazil. Earlier, the Bank of Brazil had attributed that points to all offices, even those who had only lawyers registered in the sectional in which the bank operated.

In ten of these cases, the bank was ranked first. But that does not mean she missed out. The bidding documents provides the number of offices to be hired immediately in each area. For example, to work in the civil area, aimed at preprocedural and procedural collection of debts, they will be hired immediately, two offices in Maranhão. But in the document, the Bank of Brazil reserves the right to hire other firms that are approved in the competition according to their need and convenience, pointing out that it will be observed the descending order of score in the bid. The first score of disclosure, the Nelson Wilians was first placed in 30 of 54 categories and regions bid. The bank is accused of simulating hiring attorneys who can see covered in the professional list at the time of competition and increase their score. The direction of the Office denies any irregularities.

1	BCO SA BRAZIL, BRAZIL, the Bank of Brazil is the company of the year, The movement of IPOs on the stock exchange in 2013 can be divided into two phases. The first, until the 24th of April, in which eight initial public offerings ( English Initial Public Offerings or IPOs) and sales of the listed company shares moved R $ 4.4 billion. The second phase, from the launch of the BB Security actions, a company controlled by the Bank of Brazil which is responsible for insurance, pension and capitalization of the bank. From this IPO, the second largest IPO of the stock market history, the year 2013 has become one of the most significant in stock sales, moving R $ 23.4 billion, almost the sum of 2011 and 2012. The launch of the BB Security, which is rapidly moving to become the biggest insurance company, pension plan and capitalization of the country, was worth $ 11.47 billion. investor reserves were three times the offer, and, unlike what happened with most releases of the past year, the shares awarded royally who bought. From launch until the end of August, the stock appreciated 120%, and the market value of BB Security surpassed R $ 70 billion at the end of the month, compared to R $ 92 billion the bank itself. The new company, which BB has 70% interest, has contributed earnings of R $ 2.5 billion in 2013 and R $ 1.5 billion in the first half of this year, and has fattened the results the bank in more than R $ 7 billion from the sale of securities. The success of the IPO of BB Security plus the growth in the participation of the bank in the credit market and its diversification into new markets made the Bank of Brazil to be chosen Company of the Year by THE BEST MONEY. The company's emergence was a milestone for the Bank of Brazil's business and the Brazilian capital market, says Aldemir Bendine, president of the bank. Going against the market mood, showed that consistent business does not depend on momentary analysis of the economy. Another important point is the growth in loans. BB increased its share of 20.7% of the market in the second quarter of 2013 to 21.3% in June 2014. For a bank, expand the loan portfolio always tends to be a risky move because the trend It is to capture first, the worst customer competition  ie borrowers that offer higher risk of default. However, the Bank has managed to keep default rates below the market average. In June 2013, also due to the aftermath of the increase in default in previous years, the average default of the financial system was 6.2%. At BB, this indicator was 5%. Twelve months later, the combined efforts of the banks to clean up their portfolios started to bear fruit and the average default system had fallen to 4.78%. In the case of BB, the drop was even more significant, to 3.57%. We maintain our focus on lower risk portfolios, model we have adopted long ago and now began to guide the action of other major banks  if the payroll loans, for example, says Bendine. The next steps in addition to enhancing participation in mortgage lending, which has been growing at a rate of 80% per year are to expand lending to the automotive sector through a partnership with Banco Votorantim and extend such cooperation to the credit payroll. The reasoning is simple: the Finance BV, promoter of the Votorantim sales, offers loans for car purchase in a wide network of more than 20,000 resellers of all sizes around the country nothing more logical than to take advantage of this capacity. offer payroll, low risk loans that are the new apple of the eye of the financial system. BB's goal is to maintain the pace of growth. But always seek to grow without our flexible credit policy, characterized by technical rigor and a conservative approach, says Bendine. There is room to grant more credit within the projected levels without the occurrence decrease in portfolio quality. 	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	-1	1	1	1	1	-1	1	1	1	-1	1

The trial would be held in late March, but was postponed and there is no new date. If the court finds that the percentage used by the plans was correct, many savers will not be entitled to anything. In that case, the Supreme Court can evaluate what to do with those who have received money from the banks by decision of other courts. Should the Supreme consider the irregular used index should stipulate how the payment of the correction of savings balances will be done. 	1	1	-1	0	0	1	0	1	-1	1	1	-1	1	-1	-1	-1	1	-1	1

The decision was given on the same day that the bank released the final results of the competition. The Nativity and Gonçalves Pereira Law Firm and Law Gionédis stalls, participating in the largest tender for legal services of the country, accusing the bank of disregard, counting points, defined criteria in the announcement. In case canceled extra score offered the stalls had professionals registered in more than a sectional of the Bar Association of Brazil. The Bank of Brazil would have assigned that points to all offices, even those who had only lawyers registered in the sectional in which the bank operated. The bank announced that it would give a score to all lawyers in a   note of clarification  , which responds to administrative appeals filed by stalls participating in the bidding. Changing the scoring criteria as accuse the offices, took place after the opening of the envelopes with the proposals of competitors. This, they say, is an affront to Law 8666 (Procurement Law) and hurts of death the Principle of Linking Summoning the instrument and the principle of equality. It is clear that the Bid Committee attitude of the defendant [Bank of Brazil] is covered as completely illegal, given that, based on clarification 'strangely' received and published after the final delivery date of qualification documentation and score by participants of the event offices, and modifying the essence of the rules of the notice that required for extra score that lawyers were demonstrably registered in more than one OAB benefited those competitors who did not have professionals registered in two OABs and hurt those who fulfilled editalícia rule at the appropriate time, say the stalls.

Recognizing a possible irreparable harm should the bid go ahead before this issue be discussed in court appointed, the judge accepted the request of lawyers and intimate the Bank of Brazil to manifest in the next 15 days.

By removing the notice the reason which caused the questioning, the judicial measure that theoretically would have the power to suspend the accreditation process loses its object, there is no need to talk about any damage in the orderly process of accreditation   says the lawyer.
